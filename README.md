# Alpha
My First CI/CD Project

Project Alpha is my personal initiative to apply certain new knowledge about technologies like:

- Git
- Jenkins (CI / CD)
- Java
- Selenium
- Newman
- Maven
- Docker
- Prometheus / Grafana

The idea is build a web app using the lastes technologies in CI/CD pipeline. 

This app resolves a problem related with obtain test stats for a postman collection API Request. I needed run this Postman
collection and get stats about latency, and build a Excel file with this number in a specific format.

The web UI ask for postman collection file and upload it, ask for what environment need to run, and execute test to
gathering stats, finally use a library to create excel output file and download.

This is a initial diagram of solution:
